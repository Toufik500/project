        title: "Hamlet by William Shakespeare ",
        text: `Prince Hamlet is devastated by the sudden death of his father, King Hamlet, and disturbed by his mother Gertrude's swift marriage to Claudius, the late king’s brother. The royal court of Denmark seems to accept Claudius as king, but Hamlet grows increasingly suspicious. His unease deepens when his father’s ghost appears, revealing that Claudius murdered him to seize the throne. Haunted by the revelation, Hamlet vows revenge but grapples with moral uncertainty and his own hesitation.
Feigning madness to uncover Claudius’s guilt, Hamlet alienates his friends and family, including Ophelia, the daughter of Polonius, the king’s advisor. When Hamlet accidentally kills Polonius, mistaking him for Claudius, it triggers a tragic chain of events. Ophelia descends into madness and drowns, while her brother, Laertes, returns to Denmark seeking vengeance. Claudius manipulates Laertes into plotting Hamlet’s death during a fencing match, poisoning the blade and a cup of wine meant for Hamlet.
The match spirals into chaos when Gertrude drinks the poisoned wine intended for Hamlet. In the final moments, Hamlet kills Claudius but succumbs to his own fatal wounds. Laertes also dies after confessing Claudius’s treachery. As Hamlet’s story ends, Denmark’s future lies uncertain, with the arrival of Prince Fortinbras of Norway. Shakespeare’s Hamlet remains a profound exploration of grief, vengeance, and the fragility of human existence.
